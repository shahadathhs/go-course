# Go Course

This repository is a structured learning path for mastering the Go programming
language. It is divided into three main sections:

```

go-course/
â”œâ”€â”€ basic/          # Covers fundamentals: variables, constants, data types, functions, control flow, arrays, slices, maps, structs, interfaces, imports, and more
â”œâ”€â”€ intermediate/   # Will include: concurrency (goroutines, channels), error handling, methods, composition, file I/O, testing, packages, and standard library usage
â”œâ”€â”€ advanced/       # Will include: generics, reflection, unsafe, context, advanced concurrency patterns, performance, memory profiling, and Go internals
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod          # Module definition
â””â”€â”€ main.go         # Entry point to demonstrate or run examples

```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Go installed. Then:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Or run individual files for practice:

```bash
go run basic/variables.go
```
